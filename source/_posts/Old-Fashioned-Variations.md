Some recipes, or "spec" (bartender slang for recipe), based on 
the root recipe, Old-Fashioned, are given in the book, \<Cocktail Codex\>.

The core, the balance, and the seasoning are the main elements of a cocktail
like Old-Fashioned. The classic recipe uses bourbon as the core, sugar cube 
or syrup as the balance, and the bitter as the seasoning. Recipes listed here
are combined with multiple developments on these elements.
