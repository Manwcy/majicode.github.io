## Root Recipe

Author Devon Tarby gives the two recipes of old-fashioned cocktail in the book.

### The Classic Old-Fashioned

The classic recipe of old-fashioned cocktail uses a sugar cube as the sweetness,
herbal bitters as the seasoning, and of course, bourbon whiskey as the spirit.
Lemon and orange twists work as the granish.

{% tabs Classic %}

<!-- tab Materials -->
- 1 sugar cube

- 2 **dashes** Angostura bitters

- 2 **ounces** bourbon

- ***Garnish*** : 1 **lemon** twist and 1 **orange** twist

Add the bourbon and 1 large ice cube and stir until chilled.  
Garnish with the lemon and orange twist.

### Author's Ideal Old-Fashioned

However, several drawbacks of the classic old-fashioned are mentioned.

1. First, the author select a new bourbon, which is considered to be distinct
without being too dominate. 
    
    Here, the author gives the differences of various bourbons, consisting of 
    different mixs of sweet and spicy grains.  

    - More corn and the bourbon is sweeter

    - More rye and the bourbon is drier and spicier

2. Second, instead of using a sugar cube, because of the dissolvability, a sugar syrup
makes sure that the sugar is distributed throughout the cocktail. Notes that denser 
Demerara Gum Syrup is a better recommendation.

3. Third, an additional dash of **Bitter Truth aromatic bitters** is included to 
deepen the structure.

4. Fourth, on the granishment. Squeeze, or express, the **orange twist** over the cocktail,
then rub it gently around the rim of the glass to perfume the cocktail and flavor the first
sip. Express the **lemon twist** over the cocktail. Both twists are inserted into the drink
to further flavor the cocktail.
